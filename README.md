# Caloreasy Mobile Application

Stephen Forde G00305036

This application is designed to help people who want tp keep track of their calorie intake throughout the day.
As it is just a prototype application, there are only a few food items on the application.
These foods are ones I would have deemed most popular/unpopular with the public (not everyone likes spinach!!)
The items are spread out into 3 catagories, Breakfast, Snacks and Dinner.
I used a divider in a div class to seperate each catagory.
Each item is created within a label class, and each item has a seperate count value which is totalled at the top of the screen.
There is also a seperate count system to make the reset button function. This can also be found at the top of the screen.
I created a logo in Photoshop for the application to make it more identifiable to the user.
All my images were found on Google images and uploaded through PSCP.
